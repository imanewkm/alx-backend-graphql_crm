# Understanding GraphQL

## Overview
GraphQL is a powerful query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook, that allows clients to request exactly the data they need â€” nothing more, nothing less. Unlike REST APIs, which return fixed data structures, GraphQL gives clients the flexibility to shape the response format.

We will explore the foundations of GraphQL, understand its advantages over REST, and learn how to implement GraphQL in Django using libraries like graphene-django.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

* Explain what GraphQL is and how it differs from REST.
* Describe the key components of a GraphQL schema (types, queries, mutations).
* Set up and configure GraphQL in a Django project using graphene-django.
* Build GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and manipulate data.
* Use tools like GraphiQL or Insomnia to interact with GraphQL endpoints.
* Follow best practices to design scalable and secure GraphQL APIs.
## Learning Outcomes
After completing this lesson, learners should be able to:

* Implement GraphQL APIs in Django applications.
* Write custom queries and mutations using graphene.
* Integrate Django models into GraphQL schemas.
* Optimize performance and security in GraphQL endpoints.
* Explain when to use GraphQL instead of REST in real-world projects.
## Key Concepts
* **GraphQL vs REST:** Unlike REST which has multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all operations.
* S**chema:** Defines how clients can access the data. Includes Types, Queries, and Mutations.
* Resolvers: Functions that fetch data for a particular query or mutation.
* **Graphene-Django:** A Python library that integrates GraphQL into Django seamlessly.
